# Explanation of the Go Concurrency Code Snippet

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
        go func() {
            for f := range cnp {
                f()
            }
        }()
    }
    cnp <- func() {
        fmt.Println("HERE1")
    }
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}

```

### What’s happening with `make(chan func(), 10)`?

This line creates a channel that carries functions — basically, a queue to send functions that will be executed later. The `10` means the channel can buffer up to 10 functions at once without blocking . We can think of it like a task queue with a buffer for up to 10 jobs.

---

### What about the `for` loop with 4 iterations?

The loop starts 4 goroutines — as if 4 workers running in parallel. Each worker waits in a loop, pulling functions (tasks) from the channel and running them one by one. This is a  **worker pool** pattern, letting us process multiple jobs concurrently.

---

### Why isn’t “HERE1” printing?

After setting up the workers, the program puts a function into the channel — the function prints `"HERE1"`. Then immediately the main function prints `"Hello"` and exits. The problem is the program finishes before the workers get a chance to actually run that function, so `"HERE1"` never shows up.  Goroutines aren't done yet.

---

### How to fix that?

To make sure the workers get to finish their jobs before the program exits, We can:

- Use synchronization, for e.g., `sync.WaitGroup`, to wait for the workers to complete.
- Or just add a short `sleep` after sending the function, giving workers time to run.
